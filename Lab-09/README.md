# Linear Regression – Small vs Large Dataset

## Task

Implement Linear Regression on:

* house_price_dataset_small.csv
* house_price_dataset_large.csv

Compare performance of both models.

## Steps

1. Load datasets.
2. Split into train and test sets.
3. Train Linear Regression model.
4. Predict prices.
5. Evaluate using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R².
6. Plot Actual vs Predicted graphs.

## Conclusion

Compare accuracy and errors to observe how dataset size affects model performance.
